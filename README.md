# kitty-ski-race-sim

I played this game cut out from a kids magazine over Thanksgiving and I really thought it was unplayable. It took forever and we never even got close to the finish line.

It turns out I was wrong though. As you can see in this simulation of 10,000 play-throughs, a median game should only take about 50 turns to complete, which is 25 per person in this context.

We might have just had bad luck, or the die might have been weighted against us. As you can see from the picture it's not very even. I can't role the die a bunch of times to see the distribution of roles because someone stepped on it and also that would be extremely boring.
